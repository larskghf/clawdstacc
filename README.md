# claude-stack

Persistent, remote-controllable Claude Code sessions on a macOS host (Mac mini, workstation), reachable from your phone, browser and laptop.

A single code-server instance hosts every project in the browser. Each project has its own `claude --rc` process running inside a tmux session, started and watched by launchd. Every session is reachable through the Claude iOS/Android app as a Remote Control session. A dashboard shows the status of all sessions and offers a one-click restart.

---

## What you get

- Host boots → every session starts automatically
- Phone: Claude app → Code tab → your projects, each as a Remote Control session
- Browser (LAN or VPN): `http://<host>:8443` → VSCode with all projects; the integrated terminal auto-attaches to the running Claude session
- Dashboard: `http://<host>:8390` → status overview, restart buttons
- All slash commands (`/clear`, `/compact`, …) work from anywhere
- Sessions survive reboots via `claude --continue`
- If a tmux session dies, launchd respawns it within ~10 seconds
- Full zsh login shell (Oh My Zsh, theme, plugins) in both the VSCode terminal and the tmux pane

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/claude-stack
cd ~/claude-stack

# Create the config (one-time)
cp stack.conf.example stack.conf
$EDITOR stack.conf       # at minimum, set CODESERVER_PASSWORD

# Recommended: tmux config so new panes/windows are login shells
cp tmux.conf.example ~/.tmux.conf

# Run the setup — generates plists and VSCode configs, loads launchd
./bin/setup-stack.sh

# Verify
./bin/stack-status.sh
```

After setup, open `http://<host>:8443` (code-server) and `http://<host>:8390` (dashboard) in a browser.

## Requirements

- macOS (tested on Apple Silicon; should also work on Intel — set `BREW_PREFIX` in the config)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- `tmux`, `code-server`, `python@3.12` (or another `python3`), `claude` (the Claude Code CLI) — `setup-stack.sh` checks and reports anything missing
- A Pro or Max plan for claude.ai (Remote Control needs it)
- Some VPN into your home network if you want to reach the stack from outside (Wireguard on the router, OpenVPN, Tailscale, …) — claude-stack is VPN-agnostic; everything binds on `0.0.0.0` and is reachable by IP

Install:

```bash
brew install tmux code-server python@3.12
curl -fsSL https://claude.com/install.sh | bash
claude       # run /login once
```

## Architecture

### Design goals

1. **Persistence:** sessions survive browser tabs, network drops and reboots
2. **Multi-access:** phone app, browser VSCode, SSH+tmux all attach to the same session
3. **Native — no container/VM:** macOS launchd manages everything directly, so Claude and tools have full filesystem and MCP access
4. **Idempotent:** `setup-stack.sh` can run any number of times; everything regenerates from templates
5. **Self-healing:** launchd respawns the per-project script when the tmux session dies, and the script recreates the session when it starts

### Components

**launchd** is the macOS init system. Three plist types live in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`:

- `com.user.claude-stack.<name>.plist` — one per project, runs tmux+claude
- `com.user.claude-stack.codeserver.plist` — single instance, code-server on `~`
- `com.user.claude-stack.dashboard.plist` — single instance, status dashboard

All plists set `RunAtLoad: true` (start at login) and `KeepAlive: true` (always respawn). The per-project plist is structured so that the script blocks until the tmux session dies, which gives launchd a clean signal to respawn it (see "Self-healing" below).

**tmux** is the persistence layer for `claude`. One session per project, named after the directory minus a leading underscore. Sessions live independently of any frontend — close the browser tab, drop the SSH connection, doesn't matter.

**claude --rc** is Claude Code with Remote Control enabled. Every instance registers with the Anthropic API and shows up as its own session in the Claude app. We pass `--name <projectname>` and `--remote-control-session-name-prefix <projectname>` so each session has a stable, recognizable name (the `--name` is set fresh on every start, even with `--continue`, so old persisted names get overwritten).

**code-server** is VSCode in the browser, mounted on `~`. Every project gets a `.vscode/`:
- `tasks.json` — `runOn: folderOpen` opens a terminal panel that runs `tmux attach -t <name>`
- `settings.json` — `zsh-login` as the default terminal profile (full login shell with Oh My Zsh), plus a `tmux-claude` profile, plus `workbench.panel.defaultLocation: right` so the terminal lives on the right

**dashboard.py** is a stdlib-only Python web server on port 8390. It shows the status of every component and exposes `POST /api/restart/<name>` which calls `launchctl kickstart -k`.

### Data flow: a question from the phone

1. User taps a project in the Claude app and types a question
2. Claude app sends an HTTPS request to the Anthropic API
3. The API routes it to the registered `claude --rc` process on the host, over the outbound HTTPS connection that process keeps open (no inbound ports needed)
4. The process runs locally — file reads, tool calls, MCP calls
5. The response flows back through the same path

If the same project is open in a code-server browser tab, the response shows up live in the integrated terminal too — the tmux attach there is wired to the same `claude` process.

### Self-healing

The per-project plist sets `KeepAlive: true` and `ThrottleInterval: 10`. The CDATA bash script:

1. Creates the tmux session running just `$CLAUDE_CMD` if it doesn't exist (and writes `.claude/.has-session` so `--continue` is used next time)
2. `while tmux has-session; do sleep 10; done`
3. `exit 1` once the loop ends

When `claude` exits — `/exit`, crash or external `tmux kill-session` — the pane closes, the only window is gone, the session ends, the watcher returns, the script exits non-zero, launchd respawns. End-to-end recovery measured at ~8 seconds.

Trade-off: the tmux pane no longer falls back to a login shell when Claude dies, so you can't `tmux attach` and poke around in zsh in that state. If you need to inspect, run `tmux kill-session` to force a restart, or temporarily change the plist.

### Shell environment handling

launchd-started processes do not inherit your shell environment — no `~/.zshrc`, no Oh My Zsh, no PATH from your shell config. To keep terminals usable, we set login shells in two places:

1. **vscode-settings.json.tmpl** uses `zsh-login` (`-l -i`) as the default terminal profile in code-server, so integrated terminals load your full shell config.
2. **tmux.conf.example** (optional) sets `default-command "/bin/zsh -l"` so new windows inside a tmux session also start as login shells.

This is the most common cause of "my terminal looks broken" on first setup — see `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.

### Persistence marker for `--continue`

`claude --continue` requires a previous session. There is none on the very first start — so `--continue` would fail. We use a marker file `<project>/.claude/.has-session`:

- First start: marker missing → `claude` (no `--continue`) → after a successful start the marker is written
- Later starts: marker present → `claude --continue` → resume the last conversation

Logic lives in `templates/claude.plist.tmpl`. If `~/.claude/projects/` is cleaned up externally, the marker can drift out of sync — see TROUBLESHOOTING.

### Label naming

Every plist label starts with `com.user.claude-stack.` so they group together in `launchctl list` and don't collide with anything else. `setup-stack.sh` cleans up plists that don't match the current configuration (orphans from removed projects, plus the older `com.user.claude.*` labels for migrated installs).

---

## Development & extension

### Conventions

- **Bash scripts** in `bin/` use `set -euo pipefail` and are compatible with the macOS-default Bash 3.2 (no `mapfile`/`readarray`, no `${var,,}`).
- **Templates** use `__UPPERCASE__` placeholders, replaced by `render_template()` in `setup-stack.sh`. New templates should follow the same scheme.
- **Plist labels** follow `com.user.claude-stack.<role-or-name>`. Keep this consistent — `stack-status.sh` and `dashboard.py` parse it.
- **Logs** go to `~/Library/Logs/claude-stack/<service>.{log,err}`. Don't write to `/tmp` (volatile).
- **Python in `dashboard.py`** is intentionally stdlib-only — no dependencies, no venv. If you need more, document why in a comment.

### Common extensions

**Add a new config option:**
1. Document the default in `stack.conf.example`
2. In `setup-stack.sh`, default it via `: "${VAR:=default}"`
3. If used by templates: extend the `render_template` calls with `KEY=val`
4. If the dashboard cares about it: extend `load_conf()` in `dashboard.py`

**Add a new service to the stack** (e.g. an MCP bridge, another web server):
1. Write `templates/<service>.plist.tmpl`
2. Add a `render_template` call in `setup-stack.sh`
3. Add the plist path to `ALL_PLISTS` so it gets reloaded
4. Add a status check in `stack-status.sh` and `dashboard.py`
5. Teardown picks it up automatically as long as the label matches `com.user.claude-stack.*`

**Per-project customization** (e.g. different claude flags per project):
- Currently global via `CLAUDE_EXTRA_FLAGS`. Possible extension: read `<project>/.claude-stack.yml` in `setup-stack.sh` and override at template-render time.

**Extend the dashboard:**
- Front-end is a Python string in `dashboard.py` (the `HTML` constant). Keep it small — if it grows, move it to a separate file loaded at server startup.
- All API endpoints live under `/api/`. Validate inputs strictly (see `restart_project()` for the pattern).
- Per-project stop/start could be added (`/api/stop/<name>`, `/api/start/<name>`).

### Things deliberately not included

- **No TLS:** code-server and the dashboard speak plain HTTP. The recommendation is a VPN, not direct internet exposure. If you need TLS, put a reverse proxy in front (Caddy, nginx) or use Tailscale Serve.
- **No auth on the dashboard:** the network is the auth boundary (VPN). If you ever expose the dashboard outside the LAN, add an auth layer.
- **No container/VM:** deliberate — see the architecture section.
- **No VSCode Settings Sync:** code-server's Open VSX and Microsoft's marketplace aren't sync-compatible. Install your extensions in code-server manually.
- **No automatic updates:** tools update via `brew upgrade`, not via this repo. Recommendation: `brew pin code-server tmux` for stability, then unpin + upgrade explicitly.

### Tests / verification

No automated tests — this setup is macOS-specific and hardware-dependent. Manual verification:

```bash
# Syntax checks
bash -n bin/*.sh
python3 -m py_compile bin/dashboard.py

# Smoke test (on macOS with prerequisites installed)
./bin/setup-stack.sh
./bin/stack-status.sh         # everything green?
curl -sf http://localhost:8390/api/status | python3 -m json.tool
./bin/teardown-stack.sh       # clean removal?
```

A future direction would be a ShellCheck CI pipeline for the bash scripts and possibly a dry-run mode for `setup-stack.sh` that prints the plists it would write instead of writing them.
